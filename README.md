BadApp
===================

Deliberately broken app to be used for QA training. This app will run on a Mac or Windows machine (not tested on Linux). 
It is broken in several ways that should become clear during exploratory testing. One use case is to run this in interviews
to see how someone tests, another is to have people reverse-engineer the acceptance criteria assuming the app functions
as designed.
